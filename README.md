TUTORIAL

- All functions used in the project are saved in the file function.py (used for demo on the computer) and function_for_pi.py (used for deployment on Rasphberry pi 4 model B)

- When using on pi 4 (file final.py), you need to change the line "scp -r ./file.txt duong@172.20.10.3:/home/duong/Documents/Smart_lock/storage" into the ip address, name of the device and corresponding destination file.

- If you have a Pi cam, modify my code a bit to run it with py cam, very simple.
